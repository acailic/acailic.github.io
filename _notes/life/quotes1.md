### Maximum Thinking

> "Maximum thinking isn't about endless spending or settling for tiny, comfortable stepsâ€”it's about daring to think in bold, painful, maximal increments. Real breakthroughs require long-term vision, ambition with accountability, and the patience for true discovery. Start as big as you dare, refusing to reduce your entire existence to an MVP."

### The 10x Rule

> "The 10x Rule is a simple yet powerful concept that can help you achieve your goals faster and more effectively. It states that you should aim to be 10 times better than the next best option. This means not just meeting expectations, but exceeding them and setting a new standard for excellence."
