1 - INTRO

The decision to be a good person is meaningless, unless taken from a position of free will.  So your creator has given you fundamental choices.

To cultivate your own will, or to be apathetic (which usually leaves a vacuum and other “wills” take over you)

To cultivate your own discernment, to know what are your own welcomed-influences and independent will to act, VS what are outside energies influencing you and rotting your will to where you believe you’re in control and aware, but you’re not.

To cultivate your ability to tap into the flow of the creative impulse of the universe, or to believe you can do it all “yourself”

At any point you can deny your ability to cultivate your own will, and there will be a vacuum which allows other “wills” to enter into you.

You can deny your ability to cultivate discernment, and un-welcomed outside energies will come to warp your thinking, and rot out your core essence to the point that you believe you’re aware and in control, but you’re not (you’re just adding to the pain of the world, and being attached into hooks that trap your core essence here, or even fizzles it out of existence)

You can deny your ability to cultivate your access to flow, but then you will constantly be non-unified in your action, and in a state of protection and resistance, rather than the expansion and growth of your core essence, that is really who you are.

So you ultimately have these choices to make.

2 - ALIGNING TO SOURCE ENERGY AND FLOW

So your goal, as a human being, is to constantly expand your will, to expand your discernment, to expand your ability to tap into flow.

This puts you in communion with the energy that created you.

We know that being someone who resonates with life, who emanates value and love, puts you in communion with your creator, because that is you aligning with the energy that created you.

And we know that forgiveness for people’s flaws also aligns you to creator, because your creator forgives you for the stumbles you make on your own journey.

Well in the same way, being a “FIRST MOVER” and creating something new … new “fly wheels” … bringing LIFE and CREATION where there was previously non, also puts you into alignment with your creator.

That’s why the ability to expand in love, to expand in non judgment and forgiveness, and to expand in the manifestation of your will, is so fundamentally important to your life.

So as you progress, you will finding yourself loving more deeply, being less judgmental and focusing instead on GRATITUDE, and manifesting more and more will to act.

3 - TRANSCENDING LIMITATION

Manifesting more of your will into the world means that limitations have to be transcended…

The limits imposed by your fears of failure

The limits imposed by your fears of diminishment to your ego

The limits imposed by your fear of death

The limits of physical energy

The limits of your intellect

The limits of your ability to focus

The limits of your ability to find solutions

The limits of your systems

The limits of your ability to be responsive to situations as they unfold

The limits of your body, mind and soul to channel energy

The limits imposed by everything that is leeching off of you and running you

The limits imposed by people and energy who want to limit how much you love and expand and contribute

Like Neo in the Matrix, going deeper and deeper into the program of control, and destroying everything that is sucking energy from him … you have to peel back the onion layers deep and deeper to get to the core.

4 - BECOMING UNSTOPPABLE

Yes, money is super important, but the deeper and more profound happiness come from being unstoppable.

It comes from the ability to merge completely into your will, to where you don’t even exist anymore, time stops, and you are so fully immersed into bringing your will to reality, that 

The key to doing this are…

Transcend all limitations of mind, body, and spirit, so the POTENCY of your will is not limited

Cultivate the discernment to know what is YOUR will, and other “wills” imposed on you

Learn to connect with the will of your creator, and to co-create

As you do this, you will find that you enter states of deep “knowing” and “flow” through your actions, and THROUGH that action, you will feel your core essence expand.

While we talk about money as having so much value, it is ultimately that feeling of merging completely into your will, to where it is sharpened, and potent, and laser-focused, and manifesting powerfully … that is the great reward.

Part of that should be to acquire money and resources.  For your comfort, and enjoyment.  YOU as an end, HAVE VALUE.  You should enjoy life.

But it should not be to acquire the comfort to DULL your will, and to become domesticated.

It should not blunt you to the point you no longer have your own will, and the vacuum invites in energies that enslave you, and the physical comfort is too enticing and available, so you lose the mental and spiritual habit of staying connected to flow.

5 - COMING FROM A FOUNDATION OF TOTAL COMPLETION

Begin to audit…

What you would do

How you would think

What your RAS (selective focus) would focus on

What decisions you’d make

What you’d want

…from a space of total completion.

(If time were to disappear, if you were not self conscious, if you did not have a need to get to the future, if you did not need an externally validated identity.)

You can do this, funny enough, when you DO “line up all your ducks in a row”

Lining up all your ducks in a row actually gives you a TEMPORARY sense of what it feels like to be complete.

This is valuable insofar that it gives you a taste of it.

The other way to learn about total completion is to push yourself to a “limit situation” where you just LET GO.

Or you can achieve it through spiritual practice, like meditation.

Or flow state activities, even as simple as public speaking or skiing.

Continually audit the way you are when feeling complete, and incomplete.

Then as you do so, you can begin to internalize what your will truly is, and what your will is when coming from scarcity and smallness.

6 - ALIGNING YOUR WILL

With time, as you come more and more from a space of completion, you will find that you connect more and more to the will of your creator.

The reason for this is that your creator is also coming from a space of absolute completion, but infinitely deeper than we have the capacity to comprehend or experience in our physical forms.

We have a spark of that, and can shift our point of orientation to identify with it, perceive and act through it … but our creator IS that.

But the more we are connected to that spark, and not having our essence pulled in a million directions that go up and down, the more we connect to that completion.

**Key here: Learn to distinguish when you are coming from deficit, or feel a deep completion and fulfillment, and then act from that space.

7 - PRACTICAL WAYS TO BREAK THE OLD LIMITING PATTERN

Mind, body, and soul.

Strengthen the pre-frontal cortex, extended focus, lateral thinking, problem solving, via constant challenge.

Strengthen the body to handle more energy, via exercise and rest and food.

Strengthen the soul by continually connecting to what we have talked about in the preceding videos.

Continually learn to better audit what energy and ideas and external influences are manipulating you (discernment)

Continually learn to shut off the mind, and get into a state of flow.  Focus on the present around you.  Add value.  Identify as your essence, not mind or body.  Take so much action you overwhelm the thinking mind.

Act freely, break neurotic holding patterns, express without filtering, notice what you resonate with FROM a place of completion, not lack.

Try giving, not being in scarcity, and ACTIVELY FAMILIARIZING yourself with feelings of presence and expansion

Get familiar with release muscles, and presence moving through you, animating you.

The ability to manifest your will takes energy … so fixation, craving, addiction, desires … blunts the potency needed to cultivate and manifest your own will.

It’s like you’ve had your life force drained, so there is not enough potency for fire and passion and intimacy.

As you engage with life, notice when you are being 1) triggered / activated, 2) going into the small me, 3) sourcing from early reaping, 4) creating an identity by comparison for stimulus rather than tapping into abiding flow, 5) trying to control things out of incompleteness, 6) craving things outside yourself.

As your awareness increases, you will be able to bring your will out into the world, and this ability will expand over time.
