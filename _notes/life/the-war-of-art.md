## Important points

- Resistance and Unhappiness: The author explains how Resistance manifests as a feeling of unhappiness, boredom,
  restlessness, and dissatisfaction in our lives. He warns us not to fall for the consumer culture that exploits our
  unhappiness and distracts us from doing our work. He urges us to overcome Resistance by doing the work that our inner
  genius calls us to do.
- Resistance and Fear: The author reveals that fear is a sign of Resistance and an indicator of what we have to do. He
  says that the more scared we are of a work or calling, the more important it is to our soulâ€™s evolution. He advises us
  to face our fear and do the work anyway, knowing that once we get into action, our fear will recede.
- Turning Pro: The author contrasts the amateur and the professional, and shows how the latter has learned to deal with
  Resistance by adopting a disciplined, committed, and humble attitude. He says that turning pro is a decision, an act
  of will, that we can make at any moment1. He encourages us to turn pro and do our work out of love and respect for
  ourselves and our craft.
- Beyond Resistance: The Higher Realm: The author explores the idea of a higher realm, a dimension beyond the material
  world, where unseen forces such as muses, angels, and the Self reside. He says that when we do our work, we connect
  with this realm and receive inspiration, guidance, and assistance. He suggests that we invoke the muse before we start
  our work and thank her when we finish.
