## Key Insights from Roger Love

1. Your voice is the most powerful communication tool that you possess.
2. There is no difference in voice between singing and speaking. Once you realize your voice is a musical instrument, it changes the game.
3. All speaking is public speaking and should be treated that way, whether you are talking to one person or a group.

## How To Find Your Voice That Connects With People and Moves Them Emotionally

- Your voice is not designed for you, it is a gift that you give away.
    - Sound waves are interpreted by the other person by thoughts, emotions, and memories.
    - Your voice is to make others feel something.
- Breath in through your nose so that the air becomes moist and not dry your throat.
- Chest up, shoulders back and down to not restrict the rib cages.
- Breath in through your nose and pretend you have a balloon in your abdomen. When you speak let your abdomen come back in.

## Debunking the Myth: The Words Matter

- 90% of has to do with the sounds of your voice. Pitch, Pace, Tone, Melody, Volume, and Body Language.

## Tips for Effective Speaking

- When you go down on volume at times, it sounds like you are apologizing.
