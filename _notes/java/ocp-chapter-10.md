# JDBC: Java Database Connectivity
 
# Building Database Applications with JDBC

- JDBC 4.0 and its later version support automatic loading and registration of all JDBC drivers accessible via an application‚Äôs classpath. For all earlier versions of JDBC, you must manually load the JDBC drivers using Class.forName(), before you can access the driver.
  
  // JDBC 4.0+
- DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:h2:mem:test");
  JDBC transactions:
  
- When connection‚Äôs auto-commit mode is changed during a transaction, the transaction is committed. So when auto-commit is enabled, all the ‚Äúpending‚Äù changes in the current transaction are commited.


## BASIC SQL

-  DML (Data Manipulation Language)
    - SELECT
    - INSERT
    - DELETE
    - UPDATE
    - COUNT
- DDL (Data Definition Language)
    - DROP
    - ALTER
- ETC.

---

## JDBC: Interfaces inside java.sql (for the exam)

- Driver
- Connection
- Statement
- ResultSet

Others have been added in javax.sql

---

## JDBC URL

```
protocol:vendor:database specific connection details

jdbc:postgres://localhost:5432/mydb

jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:orcl

jdbc:oracle:thin:@[HOST][:PORT]:SID
```

- used to connect to the DB
- Several samples: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEP7J_10.2.0/com.ibm.swg.ba.cognos.vvm_ag_guide.10.2.0.doc/c_ag_samjdcurlform.html

---

## Connect to a DB

- Interfaces: `java.sql.DriverManager` vs `javax.sql.DataSource`
- `DataSource`: factory, pooled, distributed
    - not covered in the exam!
- `DriverManager` covered in the exam
    - uses Factory pattern

---

## Creating a connection using DriverManager

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws SQLException {
    String url = "jdbc:derby:peopledb;create=true";

    try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url)) {
        System.out.println(connection);
    }
}
```

- also exists: `getConnection(url, user, password)`

---

## For reference only: using DataSource

```java
EmbeddedDataSource ds = new EmbeddedDataSource();
ds.setDatabaseName("test/mydb");

ds.setCreateDatabase("create");

try (Connection connection = ds.getConnection();
        Statement statement = connection.createStatement()) {

}

```

---

## Manually loading database Driver

- DriverManager search JARs that contain a `Driver` class
- looks for `META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver`
- what if our (old) driver does not have `META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver`?
    - Since JDBC 4.0 (Java 6) should be there

```java
try {
    Class.forName("org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver");
} catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```


---

## Creating a test DB from Java

```java
String url = "jdbc:derby:peopledb;create=true";

try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url);  // this Throws Exception
    Statement statement = connection.createStatement()) {
    statement.executeUpdate("Drop table person");

    statement.executeUpdate("create table PERSON " +
            "(" +
            "id integer primary key," +
            "name varchar(255)" +
            ")");

    statement.executeUpdate("insert into PERSON VALUES (1, 'Diego')");
}
```

---

## Statement: sending SQL to the DB

```java
Statement statement = connection.createStatement()

```

---



## executeUpdate

- should be called _executedSomethingThatsGonnaChangeTheDB_
- returns the number of inserted, deleted or updated rows (or 0 if it's a DDL SQL sentence)

```java
i = statement.executeUpdate("insert into PERSON VALUES (1, 'Diego')");  // i == 1

i = statement.executeUpdate("Drop table person");   // i == 0

System.out.println(statement.getUpdateCount()); // getUpdateCount also returns this
```

---

## Inserting more than one record

```sql
INSERT INTO PERSON VALUES (0, 'Person 0'), (1, 'Person 1'), ...

```

```java
statement.executeUpdate("insert into PERSON VALUES (0, 'Person 0'), (1, 'Person 1')");
```

---

## Inserting more than one record

```java
StringBuffer insertSQL = new StringBuffer("insert into PERSON VALUES ");
for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
    insertSQL.append(String.format("(%d, '%s')", j, "Person " + j));
    if (j < 9) {
        insertSQL.append(", ");
    }
}

System.out.println(insertSQL);

i = statement.executeUpdate(insertSQL.toString());
System.out.println(i);
```

---

## Deleting

---

## Updating

---

## Query

- a `executeQuery` call returns a `ResultSet` (a cursor)

```java
ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM PERSON");
while (rs.next()) {
    System.out.println(rs.getString(2));    // columns start in 1!
}
```

---

## Query

- we can also use `execute` and check if it returns a `ResultSet`

```java
boolean isResultSet = statement.execute("SELECT * FROM PERSON");
if (isResultSet) {
    ResultSet resultSet = statement.getResultSet();
    System.out.println(resultSet);
} else {
    int result = statement.getUpdateCount();
    System.out.println(result);
}

```

---

## Types of ResultSets

```java
Statement statement = connection.createStatement(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY, ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY)
```

`ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY`: can move --> only, can't see last data (snapshop), supported
`ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE`: can move <-->, can't see last data (snapshop), supported
`ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE`: can move <-->, can see last data (snapshop), not well supported

- createStatement does graceful degradation and returns the available ResultSet

---

## Concurrency modes

```
ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY: read only cursor
ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE: read/write cursor. Not required to be supported
```

- to change things in the DB we use Statements, not ResultSets

---


```java
 ResultSet resultSet = statement.getResultSet();
System.out.println(resultSet.getConcurrency() == ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE);
System.out.println(resultSet.getConcurrency() == ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE);

```

---

## Forward-only means that!

```java
Statement statement = connection.createStatement(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY, ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE)) {

ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM PERSON");
while (rs.next()) {
    System.out.println(rs.getString(2));
}

rs.first(); // Exception in thread "main" java.sql.SQLException: The 'first()' method is only allowed on scroll cursors.
System.out.println(rs.getString(2));

```

---

## Statement vs PreparedStatement

- Only `Statement` in the exam
- use `PreparedStatement` always
    - no SQL injection
    - best performance

---

## Using the wrong method

- a QUERY inside `executeUpdate`

```java
statement.executeUpdate("SELECT * FROM PERSON");
// Exception in thread "main" java.sql.SQLException: 
// Statement.executeUpdate() cannot be called with a statement that returns a ResultSet.
```

- a INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE inside `executeQuery`

```java
ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery("DELETE FROM PERSON"); 
// Exception in thread "main" java.sql.SQLException:
// Statement.executeQuery() cannot be called with a statement that returns a row count.

while (rs.next()) {
    System.out.println(rs.getString(2));
}
```

---

|Statement Method|Ret|DELETE|INSERT|UPDATE|SELECT|
|----:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|`execute()`|`boolean`|üëç|üëç|üëç|üëç|
|`execute Query()`|`ResultSet`|üëé|üëé|üëé|üëç|
|`execute Update()`|`int`|üëç|üëç|üëç|üëé|

---

## Looping through a ResultSet

- check ResultSet type: remember `ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY`, etc.
- initial position "beforeFirst"
    - `rs.beforeFirst()`, `rs.isBeforeFirst()`
- last position "after last"
    - `rs.afterLast()`, `rs.isAfterLast()`
- rs.previous(), 
- `rs.next()` -> returns true if not at the end

---

## Absolute

- moves to the absolute index provided
- returns true if there's a row there
- absolute(0) == before first
- absolute(1) == first row (if exists)
- absolute(-1) == last element
- absolute(-2) == element before last one

---

## Relative

- skips n rows from current position

---

## Accessing fields

- using name: getInt("id"), getString("name")
- using field position: getInt(1), getString(2) // starts with 1

---

## Counting

```java
ResultSet rsCount = statement.executeQuery("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM PERSON");
if (rsCount.next()) {
    String count = rsCount.getString(1);
    System.out.println(count);
}
```

---

## Times & Dates

|JDBC|Java 8|Contains|
|---|---|--:|
java.sql.Date | java.time.LocalDate | Date
java.sql.Time | java.time.LocalTime | Time
java.sql.TimeStamp | java.time. LocalDateTime | Date & Time

---

## Inserting TimeStamps

- convert into `java.sql.TimeStamp`

```java
// modify table

statement.executeUpdate("create table PERSON " +
                    "(" +
                    "id integer primary key," +
                    "name varchar(255)," +
                    "birthDate timestamp" + // added
                    ")");
// ...

StringBuffer insertSQL = new StringBuffer("insert into PERSON VALUES ");
for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
    java.sql.Timestamp timestamp = new Timestamp(LocalDateTime.now().toEpochSecond(ZoneOffset.UTC));
    insertSQL.append(String.format("(%d, '%s', '%s')", j, "Person " + j, timestamp.toString()));
    if (j < 9) {
        insertSQL.append(", ");
    }
}
```

---

## Closing database

```java
try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url);
    Statement statement = connection.createStatement(ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE, ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE)) {
        // try-with-resources: closes resources in the opposite order as they were created
}

```

- closing Connection closes statement (and resultsets)
- closing Statement closes resultsets

---

## Closing resultsets

```java
ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM PERSON");

while (rs.next()) {
    System.out.println(rs.getString("name"));
}

boolean isResultSet = statement.execute("SELECT * FROM PERSON");    // closes here
```

### JDBC

- [Connecting a DataBase](https://github.com/acailic/java8-learning/blob/master/Java-8/src/jdbc/ConnectingADataBase.java) <br />

### Questions

- java.sql.Savepoint interface of JDBC is tailor made for this purpose. At the end of each step, the process can create a save point. Later on, when the process encounters the special condition, it can roll back the transaction up to any of the previous save point and continue from there, instead of rolling back the whole transaction and losing all the values.

- A PreparedStatement is used for SQL statements that are executed multiple times with different values. For example, if you want to insert several values into a table, one after another, it is a lot easier with PreparedStatement
-  A CallableStatement is meant for executing a stored procedure, which has already been created in the database.

- Applications with JDBC 4.0, no longer need to explicitly load JDBC drivers using Class.forName().  The DriverManager methods getConnection and getDrivers have been enhanced to support the Java Standard Edition Service Provider mechanism. JDBC 4.0 Drivers must include the file META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver. This file contains the name of the JDBC drivers implementation of java.sql.Driver. For example, to load the my.sql.Driver class, the META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver file.


-  PreparedStatement offers better performance when the same query is to be run multiple times with different parameter values. If you are going to run a query only once, it may not offer better performance because it requires multiple trips to the database (one to get it pre compiled, and one to execute with the parameters) and also requires multiple method calls to set the parameters. reparedStatement has specific methods for additional SQL column type such as setBlob(int parameterIndex, Blob x) and setClob(int parameterIndex, Clob x).


- ne advantage of CallableStatement is that it allows IN/OUT parameters.  CallableStatement is the only way for a JDBC program to execute stored procedures in the database if the procedure has in and out parameters. 


- "enabling the transactions". In JDBC, transactions are always enabled. Every statement is a part of a transaction. If auto-commit is set to true, the transaction is committed after every statement (and a new transaction is started with the next query), if it is set to false, the transaction is committed when connection.commit() is called explicitly. That is why there is no begin() method in Connection.

- First, the connection's auto commit mode is set to false and then two rows are inserted. However, since autocommit is false, they are not committed yet. Now, c.rollback() is called. This will cause the whole transaction to rollback. Although we created a Savepoint, we did not pass it to rollback and so the save point will have not be respected and both the rows will be lost. This transaction ends here.  Next, row 3 is inserted in a new transaction and since autocommit is still false at this point, it is not commited yet. The transaction is still running. Now, when c.setAutoCommit(true) is called, the auto-commit status changes from false to true and this causes the existing transaction to commit thereby committing row 3.  Finally, row 4 is inserted and committed immediately because autocommit is true.


- `con.setAutoCommit(true);` 
  since auto-commit has been disabled in the given code (by calling c.setAutoCommit(false)), you have to explicitly commit the transaction to commit the changes to the database. The regular way to do this is to call con.commit(). Notice that commit method does not take any arguments.  Another way is to utilize the side effect of changing the auto-commit mode of the connection. If the setAutoCommit method is called during a transaction and the auto-commit mode is changed, the transaction is committed. If setAutoCommit is called and the auto-commit mode is not changed, the call is a no-op. In this question, con.setAutoCommit(true) changes the auto-commit mode of the connection from false to true and therefore this call commits the changes.
  
  
  
- The actual classes for Connection, Statement, and ResultSet interfaces are provided by the JDBC driver and are therefore driver dependent.
  
  The RowSet interface is unique in that it is intended to be implemented using the rest of the JDBC API. In other words, a RowSet implementation is a layer of software that executes "on top" of a JDBC driver. Implementations of the RowSet interface can be provided by anyone, including JDBC driver vendors who want to provide a RowSet implementation as part of their JDBC products. Oracle provides sample implementations of various RowSet interfaces with the JDK as well. So it is not clear whether this option is a correct option or not but we have included it because a few candidates have reported getting such a question.
