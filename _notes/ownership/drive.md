## Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us

### Autonomy
- **Take Ownership**: Identify areas where you can take ownership and make decisions. Whether it's planning your day, pursuing a hobby, or managing a project, having autonomy empowers you.
- **Set Goals**: Define your own goals and milestones. Break them down into manageable tasks, and give yourself the freedom to choose how to achieve them.

### Mastery
- **Learn Continuously**: Cultivate a growth mindset. Seek opportunities to learn new skills, whether it's through online courses, workshops, or hands-on practice.
- **Deliberate Practice**: Focus on deliberate practice in areas that matter to you. Regularly challenge yourself to improve and refine your abilities.

### Purpose
- **Connect to Meaning**: Reflect on what truly matters to you. What drives you beyond external rewards? Align your actions with a sense of purpose.
- **Impact Others**: Consider how your work or actions positively impact others. Whether it's volunteering, mentoring, or creating something valuable, purpose often lies in service.

### Extrinsic Rewards
- **Balance Rewards**: Recognize that external rewards have their place. Use them strategicallyâ€”for routine tasks or as short-term motivators.
- **Look Beyond Money**: Seek intrinsic rewards alongside financial ones. Feeling fulfilled and making a difference can be more rewarding than a paycheck.

### Self-Determination
- **Design Your Environment**: Create an environment that supports autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Eliminate unnecessary constraints and encourage exploration.
- **Surround Yourself**: Connect with people who share similar values and encourage your growth. Collaborate with those who appreciate your autonomy and purpose-driven mindset.
