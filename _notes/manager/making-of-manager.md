# Making of a Manager
### Chapter 1 
- The definition of management: The author defines management as the art of achieving a goal through the work of others. She explains that management is not about authority, status, or titles, but about helping people do their best work and creating a positive impact.
- The three core skills of management: The author identifies three core skills that every manager needs to master: purpose, people, and process. She briefly introduces each skill and how they relate to each other. She also provides a self-assessment quiz to help readers evaluate their own strengths and weaknesses as managers.
- Great managers are made, not born: The author emphasizes that management is a skill that can be learned and developed over time. She encourages readers to embrace the learning process and to seek out opportunities for growth and improvement.
- A great manager’s team will consistently achieve great outcomes, while an average or bad manager’s team will produce mediocre or poor results.
  A great manager is a positive multiplier for her team, meaning she can improve the purpose, people, and process of her team to get as high a multiplier effect on the collective outcome as possible.
  A great manager invests in the future and thinks about what she can do today that will help her team achieve more in the long term, while a bad manager focuses on the short term and does everything herself.
- The author also introduces the concept of the “manager’s mindset,” which involves thinking about the long-term impact of your actions and decisions, and the importance of building strong relationships with your team members.
