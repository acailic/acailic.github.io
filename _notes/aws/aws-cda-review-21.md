## AWS Route 53 
- TTL
- CNAME vs Alias
- Health Checks
- Routing Policies
• Simple
• Weighted
• Latency
• Failover
• Geolocation
• Multi Value
- 3rd party domains integration

### AWS Route 53 Overview
- Route53 is a Managed DNS (Domain Name System)
- DNS is a collection of rules and records which helps clients understand
how to reach a server through URLs.
- In AWS, the most common records are:
• A: hostname to IPv4
• AAAA: hostname to IPv6
• CNAME: hostname to hostname
• Alias: hostname to AWS resource.
## Route 53 – Diagram for A Record
### AWS Route 53 Overview
- Route53 can use:
• public domain names you own (or buy)
application1.mypublicdomain.com
• private domain names that can be resolved by your instances in your VPCs.
application1.company.internal
- Route53 has advanced features such as:
• Load balancing (through DNS – also called client load balancing)
• Health checks (although limited…)
• Routing policy: simple, failover, geolocation, latency, weighted, multi value
- You pay $0.50 per month per hosted zone
### DNS Records TTL (Time to Live)
- High TTL: (e.g. 24hr)
• Less traffic on DNS
• Possibly outdated records
- Low TTL: (e.g 60 s)
• More traffic on DNS
• Records are outdated
for less time
• Easy to change records
- TTL is mandatory for
each DNS record
### CNAME vs Alias
- AWS Resources (Load Balancer, CloudFront…) expose an AWS hostname:
lb1-1234.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com and you want myapp.mydomain.com
- CNAME:
• Points a hostname to any other hostname. (app.mydomain.com => blabla.anything.com)
• ONLY FOR NON ROOT DOMAIN (aka. something.mydomain.com)
- Alias:
• Points a hostname to an AWS Resource (app.mydomain.com => blabla.amazonaws.com)
• Works for ROOT DOMAIN and NON ROOT DOMAIN (aka mydomain.com)
• Free of charge
• Native health check
### Simple Routing Policy
• Maps a hostname to another hostname
• Use when you need to redirect to a
single resource
• You can’t attach health checks to simple
routing policy
• If multiple values are returned, a random
one is chosen by the client
### Weighted Routing Policy
- Control the % of the requests that go to specific endpoint
- Helpful to test 1% of traffic on new app version for example
- Helpful to split traffic between two regions
- Can be associated with Health Checks
### Latency Routing Policy
- Redirect to the server that
has the least latency close
to us
- Super helpful when latency
of users is a priority
- Latency is evaluated in
terms of user to
designated AWS Region
- Germany may be directed
to the US (if that’s the
lowest latency)
### Health Checks
- Have X health checks failed => unhealthy (default 3)
- After X health checks passed => health (default 3)
- Default Health Check Interval: 30s (can set to 10s – higher cost)
- About 15 health checkers will check the endpoint health
- => one request every 2 seconds on average
- Can have HTTP, TCP and HTTPS health checks (no SSL verification)
- Possibility of integrating the health check with CloudWatch
- Health checks can be linked to Route53 DNS queries!
### Geo Location Routing Policy
- Different from Latency based!
- This is routing based on user
location
- Here we specify: traffic from the
UK should go to this specific IP
- Should create a “default” policy
(in case there’s no match on
location)
### Multi Value Routing Policy
- Use when routing traffic to multiple resources
- Want to associate a Route 53 health checks with records
- Up to 8 healthy records are returned for each Multi Value query
- Multi Value is not a substitute for having an ELB
### Route53 as a Registrar
- A domain name registrar is an organization that manages the
reservation of Internet domain names
- Famous names:
• GoDaddy
• Google Domains
• Etc…
• And also… Route53 (e.g. AWS)!
- Domain Registrar != DNS
### 3rd Party Registrar with AWS Route 53
- If you buy your domain on 3rd party website, you can still use Route53.
• 1) Create a Hosted Zone in Route 53
• 2) Update NS Records on 3rd party website to use Route 53 name servers
- Domain Registrar != DNS
• (But each domain registrar usually comes with some DNS features)
### Questions
- You are launching an EC2 instance in us-east-1 using this Python script snippet:
(we will see SDK in a later section, for now just look at the code reference ImageId)
ec2.create_instances(ImageId='ami-b23a5e7', MinCount=1, MaxCount=1)
It works well, so you decide to deploy your script in us-west-1 as well. There, the script does not work and fails with "ami not found" error. What's the problem?:AMI is region locked and the same ID cannot be used across regions
- You would like to deploy a database technology and the vendor license bills you based on the physical cores and underlying network socket visibility. Which EC2 launch modes allow you to get visibility into them?:Dedicated Hosts
- You are running a critical workload of three hours per week, on Monday. As a solutions architect, which EC2 Instance Launch Type should you choose to maximize the cost savings while ensuring the application stability?:Scheduled Reserved Instances
