### Encryption in flight
- Why encryption?
- Encryption in flight (SSL)
- Data is encrypted before sending and decrypted after receiving
- SSL certificates help with encryption (HTTPS)
- Encryption in flight ensures no MITM (man in the middle attack) can happen
- Server side encryption at rest
- Data is encrypted after being received by the server
- Data is decrypted before being sent
- It is stored in an encrypted form thanks to a key (usually a data key)
- The encryption / decryption keys must be managed somewhere and the server must have access to it
### Client encryption
- Data is encrypted by the client and never decrypted by the server
- Data will be decrypted by a receiving client
- The server should not be able to decrypt the data
- Could leverage Envelope Encryption
### S3 Encryption for Objects (Reminder)
 There are 4 methods of encrypting objects in S3
- SSE-S3: encrypts S3 objects using keys handled & managed by AWS
- SSE-KMS: leverage AWS Key Management Service to manage encryption keys
- SSE-C: when you want to manage your own encryption keys
- Client Side Encryption
### SSE-S3
- SSE-S3: encryption using keys handled & managed by AWS S3
- Object is encrypted server side
- AES-256 encryption type
- Must set header:   “x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"
### SSE-KMS
- SSE-KMS: encryption using keys handled & managed by KMS
- KMS Advantages: user control + audit trail
- Object is encrypted server side
- Must set header:   “x-amz-server-side-encryption": ”aws:kms"
### SSE-C
- SSE-C: server-side encryption using data keys fully managed by the customer outside of AWS
- Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key you provide
- HTTPS must be used
- Encryption key must provided in HTTP headers, for every HTTP request made
### Client Side Encryption
- Client library such as the Amazon S3 Encryption Client
- Clients must encrypt data themselves before sending to S3
- Clients must decrypt data themselves when retrieving from S3
- Customer fully manages the keys and encryption cycle
### Encryption in transit (SSL)
- AWS S3 exposes:
• HTTP endpoint: non encrypted
• HTTPS endpoint: encryption in flight
- You’re free to use the endpoint you want, but HTTPS is recommended
- HTTPS is mandatory for SSE-C
- Encryption in flight is also called SSL / TLS
### AWS KMS (Key Management Service)
- Anytime you hear “encryption” for an AWS service, it’s most likely KMS
- Easy way to control access to your data, AWS manages keys for us
- Fully integrated with IAM for authorization
- Seamlessly integrated into:
- Amazon EBS: encrypt volumes
- Amazon S3: Server side encryption of objects
- Amazon Redshift: encryption of data
- Amazon RDS: encryption of data
- Amazon SSM: Parameter store
- But you can also use the CLI / SDK

### AWS KMS 101
- Anytime you need to share sensitive information… use KMS
• Database passwords
• Credentials to external service
• Private Key of SSL certificates
- The value in KMS is that the CMK used to encrypt data can never be retrieved by the user, and the CMK can be rotated for extra security
- Never ever store your secrets in plaintext, especially in your code!
- Encrypted secrets can be stored in the code / environment variables
- KMS can only help in encrypting up to 4KB of data per call
- If data > 4 KB, use envelope encryption
- To give access to KMS to someone:
• Make sure the Key Policy allows the user
• Make sure the IAM Policy allows the API calls
### AWS KMS (Key Management Service)
- Able to fully manage the keys & policies:
• Create
• Rotation policies
• Disable
• Enable
- Able to audit key usage (using CloudTrail)
- Three types of Customer Master Keys (CMK):
• AWS Managed Service Default CMK: free
• User Keys created in KMS: $1 / month
• User Keys imported (must be 256-bit symmetric key): $1 / month
+ pay for API call to KMS ($0.03 / 10000 calls)
### Encryption in AWS Services
- Requires migration (through Snapshot / Backup):
• EBS Volumes
• RDS databases
• ElastiCache
• EFS network file system
- In-place encryption:S3
### CloudHSM
- KMS => AWS manages the software for encryption
- CloudHSM => AWS provisions encryption hardware
- Dedicated Hardware (HSM = Hardware Security Module)
- You manage your own encryption keys entirely (not AWS)
- HSM device is tamper resistant, FIPS 140-2 Level 3 compliance
- CloudHSM clusters are spread across Multi AZ (HA) – must setup
- Supports both symmetric and asymmetric encryption (SSL/TLS keys)
- No free tier available
- Must use the CloudHSM Client Software
- Redshift supports CloudHSM for database encryption and key management
- Good option to use with SSE-C encryption
### CloudHSM vs KMS
### Security - Kinesis
- Kinesis Data Streams
- SSL endpoints using the HTTPS protocol to do encryption in flight
- AWS KMS provides server-side encryption [Encryption at rest]
- For client side-encryption, you must use your own encryption libraries
- Supported Interface VPC Endpoints / Private Link – access privately
- KCL – must get read / write access to DynamoDB table
- Kinesis Data Firehose:
- Attach IAM roles so it can deliver to S3 / ES / Redshift / Splunk
- Can encrypt the delivery stream with KMS [Server side encryption]
- Supported Interface VPC Endpoints / Private Link – access privately
- Kinesis Data Analytics
- Attach IAM role so it can read from Kinesis Data Streams and reference sources and write to an output destination (example Kinesis Data Firehose)
### Security - SQS

### AWS STS – Security Token Service
- Allows to grant limited and TEMPORARY access to AWS resources.
- Token is valid for up to one hour (must be refreshed)
- Cross Account Access
• Allows users from one AWS account access resources in another
- Federation (Active Directory)
• Provides a non-AWS user with temporary AWS access by linking users Active Directory credentials
• Uses SAML (Security Assertion markup language)
• Allows Single Sign On (SSO) which enables users to log in to AWS console without assigning IAM credentials
- Federation with third party providers / Cognito
• Used mainly in web and mobile applications
• Makes use of Facebook/Google/Amazon etc to federate them
### Cross Account Access
- Define an IAM Role for another account to access
- Define which accounts can access this IAM Role
- Use AWS STS (Security Token Service) to retrieve credentials and impersonate the IAM Role you have access to (AssumeRole API)
- Temporary credentials can be valid between 15 minutes to 1 hour
### Identity Federation
- Federation lets users outside of AWS to assume temporary role for accessing AWS resources.
- These users assume identity provided access role.
- Federation assumes a form of 3rd party authentication
• LDAP
• Microsoft Active Directory (~= SAML)
• Single Sign On
• Open ID
• Cognito
- Using federation, you don’t need to create IAM users (user management is outside of AWS)
### SAML Federation For Enterprises
- To integrate Active Directory / ADFS with AWS (or any SAML 2.0)
- Provides access to AWS Console or CLI (through temporary creds)
-  No need to create an IAM user for each of your employees
### AWS Cognito - Federated Identity Pools For Public Applications
- Goal:Provide direct access to AWS Resources from the Client Side
- How:
• Log in to federated identity provider – or remain anonymous
• Get temporary AWS credentials back from the Federated Identity Pool
• These credentials come with a pre-defined IAM policy stating their permissions
- Example:provide (temporary) access to write to S3 bucket using Facebook Login
### Policies – leveraging AWS variables
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_polici es_variables.html
• ${aws:username} : to restrict users to tables / buckets
• ${aws:principaltype} : account, user, federated, or assumed role
• ${aws:PrincipalTag/department} : to restrict using Tags
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_polici es_iam-condition-keys.html#condition-keys-wif
• ${aws:FederatedProvider} : which IdP was used for the user (Cognito, Amazon..)
• ${www.amazon.com:user_id} , ${cognito-identity.amazonaws.com:sub} …
• ${saml:sub}, ${sts:ExternalId}
- For S3 - let’s analyze the policies at: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html
- For DynamoDB – let’s analyze the policies at: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developergui de/specifying-conditions.html
- Note for RDS – IAM policies don’t help with in-database security, as it’s a proprietary technology and we are responsible for users & authorization

### AWS CloudTrail
- Provides governance, compliance and audit for your AWS Account
- CloudTrail is enabled by default!
- Get an history of events / API calls made within your AWS Account by:
• Console
• SDK
• CLI
• AWS Services
- Can put logs from CloudTrail into CloudWatch Logs
- If a resource is deleted in AWS, look into CloudTrail first!
- CloudTrail shows the past 90 days of activity
- The default UI only shows “Create”, “Modify” or “Delete” events
- CloudTrail Trail:
• Get a detailed list of all the events you choose
• Ability to store these events in S3 for further analysis
• Can be region specific or global
- CloudTrail Logs have SSE-S3 encryption when placed into S3
- Control access to S3 using IAM, Bucket Policy, etc…
### VPC Endpoints
- Endpoints allow you to connect to AWS Services using a private network instead of the public www network
- They scale horizontally and are redundant
- They remove the need of IGW, NAT, etc… to access AWS Services
- Gateway: provisions a target and must be used in a route table. ONLY S3 and DynamoDB
- Interface: provisions an ENI (private IP address) as an entry point (must attach security group) – most AWS services Also called VPC PrivateLink
### Questions
- Server side encryption means that the data is sent encrypted to the server first:False.
- In server side encryption, only the encryption happens on the server. Where does the decryption happen?: The Server.
- We need to gain access to a Role in another AWS account. How is it done?:We should use the STS service to gain temporary credentials
- You have a mobile application and would like to give your users access to their own personal space in Amazon S3. How do you achieve that?:Use Cognito Identity Federation.
- You need an encryption service that supports asymmetric encryption schemes. Which service could you use?:CloudHSM
- We'd like to encrypt 100MB of data client side before uploading it to S3. We should use: Eveloppe Encryption
- You would like to ensure data is encrypted client side before being sent to Kinesis. What should you use?:You must create custom code
- Which technology allows you to access the AWS service from your private subnets without the need to have an outgoing internet connection?:VPC Endpoints
- What do you need to attach to an IoT rule's engine action to ensure it's capable of sending data directly into Kinesis?:An IAM role
- Users must be created within DynamoDB. : FALSE. The entire security in DynamoDB is managed through IAM, we don't need to create users within DynamoDB (unlike RDS) .
