### KMS, Encryption SDK, SSM Parameter Store
####  Encryption in flight (SSL)
- Data is encrypted before sending and decrypted after receiving
- SSL certificates help with encryption (HTTPS)
- Encryption in flight ensures no MITM (man in the middle attack) can happen
#### Server side encryption at rest
- Data is encrypted after being received by the server
- Data is decrypted before being sent
- It is stored in an encrypted form thanks to a key (usually a data key)
- The encryption / decryption keys must be managed somewhere and
the server must have access to it
####  Client side encryption
- Data is encrypted by the client and never decrypted by the server
- Data will be decrypted by a receiving client
- The server should not be able to decrypt the data
- Could leverage Envelope Encryption
#### AWS KMS (Key Management Service)
- Anytime you hear “encryption” for an AWS service, it’s most likely KMS
- Easy way to control access to your data, AWS manages keys for us
- Fully integrated with IAM for authorization
• Seamlessly integrated into:
• Amazon EBS: encrypt volumes
• Amazon S3: Server side encryption of objects
• Amazon Redshift: encryption of data
• Amazon RDS: encryption of data
• Amazon SSM: Parameter store
• Etc…
- But you can also use the CLI / SDK
#### KMS – Customer Master Key (CMK) Types
• Symmetric (AES-256 keys)
• First offering of KMS, single encryption key that is used to Encrypt and Decrypt
• AWS services that are integrated with KMS use Symmetric CMKs
• Necessary for envelope encryption
• You never get access to the Key unencrypted (must call KMS API to use)
• Asymmetric (RSA & ECC key pairs)
• Public (Encrypt) and Private Key (Decrypt) pair
• Used for Encrypt/Decrypt, or Sign/Verify operations
• The public key is downloadable, but you access the Private Key unencrypted
• Use case: encryption outside of AWS by users who can’t call the KMS API
####  AWS KMS (Key Management Service)
- Able to fully manage the keys & policies:
• Create
• Rotation policies
• Disable
• Enable
- Able to audit key usage (using CloudTrail)
- Three types of Customer Master Keys (CMK):
• AWS Managed Service Default CMK: free
• User Keys created in KMS: $1 / month
• User Keys imported (must be 256-bit symmetric key): $1 / month
- + pay for API call to KMS ($0.03 / 10000 calls)
####  AWS KMS 101
- Anytime you need to share sensitive information… use KMS
• Database passwords
• Credentials to external service
• Private Key of SSL certificates
- The value in KMS is that the CMK used to encrypt data can never be
retrieved by the user, and the CMK can be rotated for extra security
- Never ever store your secrets in plaintext, especially in your code!
- Encrypted secrets can be stored in the code / environment variables
- KMS can only help in encrypting up to 4KB of data per call
- If data > 4 KB, use envelope encryption
- To give access to KMS to someone:
• Make sure the Key Policy allows the user
• Make sure the IAM Policy allows the API calls
#### KMS Key Policies
- Control access to KMS keys, “similar” to S3 bucket policies
- Difference: you cannot control access without them
- Default KMS Key Policy:
• Created if you don’t provide a specific KMS Key Policy
• Complete access to the key to the root user = entire AWS account
• Gives access to the IAM policies to the KMS key
- Custom KMS Key Policy:
• Define users, roles that can access the KMS key
• Define who can administer the key
• Useful for cross-account access of your KMS key
#### Copying Snapshots across accounts
1. Create a Snapshot, encrypted with
your own CMK
2. Attach a KMS Key Policy to
authorize cross-account access
3. Share the encrypted snapshot
4. (in target) Create a copy of the
Snapshot, encrypt it with a KMS Key
in your account
5. Create a volume from the snapshot
#### How does KMS work?
API – Encrypt and Decrypt
#### Envelope Encryption
- KMS Encrypt API call has a limit of 4 KB
- If you want to encrypt >4 KB, we need to use Envelope Encryption
- The main API that will help us is the GenerateDataKey API
- For the exam: anything over 4 KB of data that needs to be encrypted
must use the Envelope Encryption == GenerateDataKey API
#### Deep dive into Envelope Encryption GenerateDataKey API
#### Deep dive into Envelope Encryption Decrypt envelope data
#### Encryption SDK
- The AWS Encryption SDK implemented Envelope Encryption for us
- The Encryption SDK also exists as a CLI tool we can install
- Implementations for Java, Python, C, JavaScript
- Feature - Data Key Caching:
• re-use data keys instead of creating new ones for each encryption
• Helps with reducing the number of calls to KMS with a security trade-off
• Use LocalCryptoMaterialsCache (max age, max bytes, max number of messages)
#### KMS Symmetric – API Summary
- Encrypt: encrypt up to 4 KB of data through KMS
- GenerateDataKey: generates a unique symmetric data key (DEK)
• returns a plaintext copy of the data key
• AND a copy that is encrypted under the CMK that you specify
- GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext:
• Generate a DEK to use at some point (not immediately)
• DEK that is encrypted under the CMK that you specify (must use Decrypt later)
- Decrypt: decrypt up to 4 KB of data (including Data Encryption Keys)
- GenerateRandom: Returns a random byte string
#### KMS Request Quotas
- When you exceed a request quota, you get a ThrottlingException:
- To respond, use exponential backoff (backoff and retry)
- For cryptographic operations, they share a quota
- This includes requests made by AWS on your behalf (ex: SSE-KMS)
- For GenerateDataKey, consider using DEK caching from the Encryption SDK
- You can request a Request Quotas increase through API or AWS support
##### KMS Request Quotas
#### S3 Encryption for Objects
- There are 4 methods of encrypting objects in S3
• SSE-S3: encrypts S3 objects using keys handled & managed by AWS
• SSE-KMS: leverage AWS Key Management Service to manage encryption keys
• SSE-C: when you want to manage your own encryption keys
• Client Side Encryption
- It’s important to understand which ones are adapted to which situation
for the exam
#### SSE-KMS
- SSE-KMS: encryption using keys handled & managed by KMS
- KMS Advantages: user control + audit trail
- Object is encrypted server side
• Must set header: “x-amz-server-side-encryption": ”aws:kms"
#### SSE-KMS Deep Dive
- SSE-KMS leverages the GenerateDataKey & Decrypt KMS API calls
- These KMS API calls will show up in CloudTrail, helpful for logging
- To perform SSE-KMS, you need:
• A KMS Key Policy that authorizes the user / role
• An IAM policy that authorizes access to KMS
• Otherwise you will get an access denied error
- S3 calls to KMS for SSE-KMS count against your KMS limits
• If throttling, try exponential backoff
• If throttling, you can request an increase in KMS limits
- The service throttling is KMS, not Amazon S3
#### S3 Bucket Policies – Force SSL
#### S3 Bucket Policy – Force Encryption of SSE-KMS
1. Deny incorrect encryption
header: make sure it includes
aws:kms (== SSE-KMS)
2. Deny no encryption header to
ensure objects are not
uploaded un-encrypted
• Note: could swap 2) for S3
default encryption of SSE-KMS
#### SSM Parameter Store
- Secure storage for configuration and secrets
- Optional Seamless Encryption using KMS
- Serverless, scalable, durable, easy SDK
- Version tracking of configurations / secrets
- Configuration management using path & IAM
- Notifications with CloudWatch Events
- Integration with CloudFormation
#### SSM Parameter Store Hierarchy
#### Standard and advanced parameter tiers
#### Parameters Policies (for advanced parameters)
#### AWS Secrets Manager
- Newer service, meant for storing secrets
- Capability to force rotation of secrets every X days
- Automate generation of secrets on rotation (uses Lambda)
- Integration with Amazon RDS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Aurora)
- Secrets are encrypted using KMS
- Mostly meant for RDS integration
#### SSM Parameter Store vs Secrets Manager
- Secrets Manager ($$$):
• Automatic rotation of secrets with AWS Lambda
• Integration with RDS, Redshift, DocumentDB
• KMS encryption is mandatory
• Can integration with CloudFormation
- SSM Parameter Store ($):
• Simple API
• No secret rotation
• KMS encryption is optional
• Can integration with CloudFormation
• Can pull a Secrets Manager secret using the SSM Parameter Store API
#### CloudWatch Logs - Encryption
- You can encrypt CloudWatch logs with KMS keys
- Encryption is enabled at the log group level, by associating a CMK with a
log group, either when you create the log group or after it exists.
- You cannot associate a CMK with a log group using the CloudWatch
console.
- You must use the CloudWatch Logs API:
• associate-kms-key : if the log group already exists
• create-log-group: if the log group doesn’t exist yet
#### CodeBuild Security
- To access resources in your VPC, make sure you specify a VPC
configuration for your CodeBuild
- Secrets in CodeBuild:
- Don’t store them as plaintext in environment variables
- Instead:
• Environment variables can reference parameter store parameters
• Environment variables can reference secrets manager secrets
-
### Questions
- To enable encryption in flight, we need to have?-an HTTPS endpoint with a SSL certificate
- Server side encryption means that the data is sent encrypted to the server first-false
- In server side encryption, only the encryption happens on the server. Where does the decryption happen?-both happen on server side
- In client side encryption, the server must know our encryption scheme to accept the data-False
- We need to create User Keys in KMS before using the encryption features for EBS, S3, etc: false, we can use the aws managed service keys in KMS
- We'd like to encrypt 400 KB of data. We should use: AWS KMS GenerateDataKey call and encrypt client side
- We'd like our Lambda function to have access to a database password. We should: Have it as an encrypted environment variable and decrypt it at runtime
- We would like to audit the values of an encryption value over time: We should use SSM Parameter Store
- An EC2 instance is trying to download a file from S3 that is encrypted with SSE:KMS. It's getting a denied exception, even though the IAM policy allows access to that S3 object. What do you recommend?-Add permission for KMS:Decrypt
- You would like to store secrets and have automatic rotation. What's your recommendation?- automatic rotation is natively supported in Secrets Manager
- How to encrypt existing CloudWatch Logs?-Encrypt with them with the  associate-kms-key API call
