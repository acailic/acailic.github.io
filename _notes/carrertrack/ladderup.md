QUICKEST WAY TO CLIMB THE LADDER AT WORK (AND AVOID THE SNAKES)

ACT LIKE AN EMPLOYER, NOT AN EMPLOYEE
Think like an employer to become irreplaceable. Focus on improving the business and adding value beyond your job description.

ALIGN YOUR WORK AND HOME PRIORITIES
Remember, the people you work for are waiting for you at home. Plan and organize your life outside of work just as you do your work life.

SWALLOW THE FROG FOR YOUR MANAGER
Take on tasks your manager dislikes. This makes you invaluable and can lead to quicker career growth. Handling these tasks broadens your skill set and eases your manager’s workload.

SPEAK UP
Don’t be afraid to share your ideas and expertise. Speaking up shows your knowledge and confidence.

DO YOUR JOB WELL (BASIC BUT NOT ALWAYS DONE)
Your work ethic and performance define your growth. Build a reputation for reliability, as reliable people are the ones who get promoted.

FEEDBACK DOESN’T MEAN YOU’RE THE WORST PERSON EVER LIVED
Treat feedback as fertilizer. Listen, appreciate, and reflect on it. Consider why it might be true or not, and act on it.

WORK ON WHAT’S VISIBLE AND MEASURABLE
Choose jobs where your achievements are clear and quantifiable. This makes it easier to get promotions. Focus on results that matter to leadership and work closely with them.

DON’T BE REALISTIC, ALTER YOUR REALITY INSTEAD
Your perception shapes your reality. Seek new experiences and surround yourself with people you aspire to be like to alter your reality.

EITHER EARN OR LEARN
Ensure every job offers learning or earning potential, ideally both. If it offers neither, look for another job.

EVERY ROLE IS LEADERSHIP
Leaders get promoted. Learn leadership skills, build strong relationships at all levels, and take charge of projects you’re involved in.

LIFE IS TOO SHORT TO BE MISERABLE
Don’t stay in a job that makes you unhappy. If you have a bad manager or dread every day, find a way to change your situation or leave.

SOLVE PROBLEMS, DON’T JUST IDENTIFY THEM
When you bring an issue to your boss, propose a solution too. Leaders are busy and will appreciate your initiative and resourcefulness.

SERVE AS A VAULT
Earn trust by keeping confidential or sensitive information to yourself. By being reliable and trustworthy, you’ll gain everyone’s respect.
