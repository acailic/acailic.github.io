> The keyword I always come back to is leverage.

> AI is taking over? Use that information to your advantage. Ask yourself these questions:
> 
> - How can I leverage these new tools to create even more opportunities for myself?
> - What skills can I leverage to make myself more marketable or efficient at generating value for others?
> - What other non-AI-related tools can I leverage to force-multiply my output, whether that is with code or impact?
> - What are the areas in my life that I can improve that will raise my base competency, whereby these tools can then multiply (not all areas can be multiplied with software)?
>   - My health?
>   - My cognition through a better sleep schedule?
>   - My typing speed?
>   - My knowledge of IDE keyboard shortcuts?
>   - Design patterns?
> 
> Every little bit contributes to becoming AI-proof, but it is ultimately about standing out from the crowd and doing what the competition is too lazy or unaware to do.
> 
> Should we do start integrating AI in all our projects/workstreams in order to stay sharp?

> Yes! Ever wonder how some people are so productive? Hint: it's mainly the tools they use and the systems and processes they've developed that work best for them.
