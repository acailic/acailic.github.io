# Staff Engineer
## Overview
## Operating at Staff
- Work on what matters: Avoid low-impact and easy tasks, and focus on the high-impact and hard ones. Align your work with the company’s goals and priorities, and communicate your impact clearly and frequently.
- Writing engineering strategy: Write clear and concise documents that articulate the problem, the solution, and the rationale behind your technical decisions. Use a structure like SCQA (Situation, Complication, Question, Answer) to guide your readers through your logic.
- Managing technical quality: Establish and enforce standards for code quality, testing, performance, security, and reliability. Use tools like code reviews, linters, automated tests, and monitoring to ensure quality. Educate and mentor other engineers on best practices and trade-offs.
- Stay aligned with authority: Understand the expectations and constraints of your role and your organization. Seek feedback and sponsorship from your manager and other leaders. Respect the decision-making process and avoid undermining or circumventing it.
- To lead, you have to follow: Support your team’s vision and goals, and collaborate with other engineers and stakeholders1. Be open to feedback and criticism, and admit your mistakes. Delegate and empower others to take ownership and responsibility.
- Learn to never be wrong: Use data and evidence to back up your claims and arguments. Be humble and curious, and seek to learn from others. Avoid jumping to conclusions or making assumptions. Test your ideas and hypotheses before implementing them.
- Create space for others: Share your knowledge and expertise with others, and help them grow and succeed. Sponsor and advocate for other engineers, especially those from underrepresented groups. Recognize and celebrate the achievements and contributions of others.
## Getting the title where you are
## Deciding to switch companies
- Know your reasons for switching: Are you looking for more impact, more learning, more recognition, more compensation, or something else? Be honest with yourself and prioritize your needs and wants.
- Research the company and role: Find out as much as you can about the company’s culture, values, vision, strategy, engineering practices, and expectations for the role. Use sources like Glassdoor, LinkedIn, Twitter, blogs, podcasts, and your network to get a balanced perspective.
- Prepare for the interview process: Review your resume, portfolio, and online presence. Brush up on your technical skills, problem-solving, and communication. Practice with mock interviews, coding challenges, and behavioral questions. Be ready to showcase your strengths and address your weaknesses.
- Negotiate your offer: Don’t accept the first offer without trying to negotiate for a better one. Consider the total compensation package, not just the salary. Use data from sites like Levels.fyi, Paysa, or Salary.com to benchmark your market value. Ask for more than you expect to get, but be respectful and realistic.
