# Staff Engineer
## Overview
## Operating at Staff
## Getting the title where you are
## Deciding to switch companies
- Know your reasons for switching: Are you looking for more impact, more learning, more recognition, more compensation, or something else? Be honest with yourself and prioritize your needs and wants.
- Research the company and role: Find out as much as you can about the company’s culture, values, vision, strategy, engineering practices, and expectations for the role. Use sources like Glassdoor, LinkedIn, Twitter, blogs, podcasts, and your network to get a balanced perspective.
- Prepare for the interview process: Review your resume, portfolio, and online presence. Brush up on your technical skills, problem-solving, and communication. Practice with mock interviews, coding challenges, and behavioral questions. Be ready to showcase your strengths and address your weaknesses.
- Negotiate your offer: Don’t accept the first offer without trying to negotiate for a better one. Consider the total compensation package, not just the salary. Use data from sites like Levels.fyi, Paysa, or Salary.com to benchmark your market value. Ask for more than you expect to get, but be respectful and realistic.
